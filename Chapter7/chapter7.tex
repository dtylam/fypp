\chapter{Evaluation}

Coming to the end of the project, evaluation is needed to measure and draw conclusions 
on its effectiveness. The project will be evaluated in two ways: 
software testing and user evaluation.

\section{Software Testing}

White box testing. Why?

A requirements testing tracibility matrix in the format of [TODO] is used.

The test results are overall positive.

It may be biased because it is performed by me.

\section{User Evaluation}

User evaluation is important because...

\subsection{Methodology}
[TODO]

Method: qualitative

Instrument: Why interviews? Likert Scale and semi-structured.

Sample: Who are they? Why? Convenience Sampling. Limitation: all CS department.

An ethics submission was completed on BREO and approval granted on 14th March. 
See Appendix (TODO) for the approved participant information sheet, consent form and example questions.

A total of four interviews were conducted in March 2018: 
two with teaching staff and two with student representatives. 
Three of the participants (A, C, E) are return participants from the requirements gathering interviews in Chapter 4.
See table \ref{table:participants-eval} for a more detailed description of these participants.

        Educator F & lecturer in higher education for over 10 years\\\midrule
        Student C & a university course representative for 3 years, which involves collecting and 
        communicating student feedback and attending staff-student liaison meetings \\\midrule
        Student E & a university course representative for 2 years and a peer assisted learning leader 
        for 1 year\\\bottomrule
    \end{tabularx}
\end{table}


\subsection{Interview Results and Analysis}

Likert Scale

The raw data from interviews (transcripts) were contextually analysed and grouped into problem statements (PS), 

Any specifics regarding course, staff and event details have been anonymised.
