\chapter{Evaluation}

Coming to the end of the project, evaluation is needed to measure and draw conclusions
on its effectiveness. The project will be evaluated in two ways:
software testing and user evaluation.

\section{Software Testing}

One way to determine product quality is to evaluate the extent to which each stated requirement 
has been fulfilled \citep{bach1999risk}. Since the requirements for this project addresses directly 
several of the problems found in literature and interviews with stakeholders, a high quality product 
that satisfies the requirements would make the project more of a success.

This can be done with black box testing, with test cases that are traceable to one or more of 
the requirements as stated in Chapter 4.2.

The full list of test cases run are listed in Appendix E. The test results are overall positive. 
Out of the 19 test cases developed, only 4 test cases were not completely passing.

See Table \ref{fig:failed_tests} for the remedial actions were conducted for the failed tests.

A limitation of these tests are that they are performed by the same person as the developer, 
and could lead to biased results. 
For example, no test cases have been developed for non-functional requirements NR4 and NR5, 
because they describe criteria that cannot be objectively assessed by the developer.

\section{User Evaluation}

The aims of the project aims to deliver benefits to students and teachers. 
It is therefore important to evaluate what these real world stakeholders think about the project deliverables.

\subsection{Methodology}

A qualitative user evaluation study was used.
[TODO]
Method: qualitative

Instrument: Why interviews? Likert Scale and semi-structured.

Sample: Who are they? Why? Convenience Sampling. Limitation: all CS department.

An ethics submission was completed on BREO and approval granted on 14th March.
See Appendix (TODO) for the approved participant information sheet, consent form and example questions.

A total of four interviews were conducted in March 2018:
two with teaching staff and two with student representatives.
Three of the participants (A, C, E) are return participants from the requirements gathering interviews in Chapter 4.
See table \ref{table:participants-eval} for a more detailed description of these participants.

	\end{tabularx}
\end{table}

\subsection{Interview Results and Analysis}

To better draw conclusions on the aims and objectives of this project, a Likert-type scale is used
for the first eight structured questions. This is to encourage participants to express an opinion about the guiding statements,
not for quantitative analysis. See Table \ref{table:structuredresp_eval} for the response values for these first eight questions, 
where 1 is for Strongly disagree, 2 for Disagree, 3 for Neither agree nor disagree, 4 for Agree and 5 for Strongly agree.

Overall, the participants have rated the demonstrator system positively.
None of the participants have disagreed with the above statements about the demonstrator, 
which is an encouraging sign.

Moving on, the rest of the raw data from interviews (transcripts) were contextually analysed and grouped thematically into 
observational statements (OS) and functionality suggestions (FS).

\section{Conclusion}

The demonstrator system has been a moderate success. 15 out of 19 of the requirement-based test cases have been passed and 
user evaluation feedback has been positive overall.
All of the participants interviewed said they would enrol into a platform like this in the future, 
praising its transparency, security and user experience.

Going back to the objectives of the project of what the demonstrator should be able to do by adopting a blockchain back-end:

\begin{itemize}
	\item improve transparency in assessments 
	\item improve curriculum personalisation
	\item improve security, privacy and access control
\end{itemize}

These objectives have been achieved well.
