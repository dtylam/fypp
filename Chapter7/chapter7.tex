\chapter{Evaluation}

Coming to the end of the project, evaluation is needed to measure and draw conclusions
on its effectiveness. The project will be evaluated in two ways:
software testing and user evaluation.

\section{Software Testing}

White box testing. Why?

A requirements testing tracibility matrix in the format of [TODO] is used.

The test results are overall positive.

It may be biased because it is performed by me.

\section{User Evaluation}

User evaluation is important because...

\subsection{Methodology}
[TODO]

Method: qualitative

Instrument: Why interviews? Likert Scale and semi-structured.

Sample: Who are they? Why? Convenience Sampling. Limitation: all CS department.

An ethics submission was completed on BREO and approval granted on 14th March.
See Appendix (TODO) for the approved participant information sheet, consent form and example questions.

A total of four interviews were conducted in March 2018:
two with teaching staff and two with student representatives.
Three of the participants (A, C, E) are return participants from the requirements gathering interviews in Chapter 4.
See table \ref{table:participants-eval} for a more detailed description of these participants.

\subsection{Interview Results and Analysis}

To better draw conclusions on the aims and objectives of this project, a Likert-type scale is used
for the first eight structured questions. This is to encourage participants to express an opinion about the guiding statements,
not for quantitative analysis. See Table \ref{table:structuredresp_eval} for the response values for these first eight questions, 
where 1 is for Strongly disagree, 2 for Disagree, 3 for Neither agree nor disagree, 4 for Agree and 5 for Strongly agree.

Overall, the participants have rated the demonstrator system positively.

The rest of the raw data from interviews (transcripts) were contextually analysed and grouped into 
observational statements (OS) and functionality suggestions (FS).

\section{Conclusion}

The demonstrator system has been a moderate success.
All of the participants interviewed said they would enrol into a platform like this in the future, 
praising its transparency, security and user experience.

Going back to the objectives of the project of what the demonstrator should be able to do by adopting a blockchain back-end:

\begin{itemize}
	\item improve transparency in assessments 
	\item improve curriculum personalisation
	\item improve security, privacy and access control
\end{itemize}

These objectives have been achieved well.
