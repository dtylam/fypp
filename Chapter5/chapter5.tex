Following the discussion in Chapter 2.3.1 and 2.5, the designs for this project 
will be created on top of Hyperledger Fabric, a public permissioned blockchain.
It has become clear that a blockchain specific, high-fidelity prototyping tool is needed 
to create system designs such as data and transaction models.

\section{Design Tool}

Hyperledger Composer is an open source development toolset and framework that aims to 
accelerate time to value for blockchain projects. It offers business-centric 
abstractions, allowing business owners and developers to rapidly develop 
use cases and model a blockchain network. The design tools offered take the forms of:
\begin{itemize}
    \setlength\itemsep{0em}            
    \item An object-oriented modelling language (.cto file) to define data models in 
    the blockchain network for assets, participants and transactions
    \item JavaScript functions (.js file) to define logic for smart contracts triggered by transactions
    \item An access control language (.acl file) to define access rules for records on the blockchain\\
    \citep{official2018composer}
\end{itemize}

See Figure \ref{fig:composer2fabric} for a visual explainer of how Hyperledger Composer 
helps designers and developers create these high level definitions.

A significant advantage of using Hyperledger Composer is its ability to package these 
prototype definitions and deploy it to Hyperledger Fabric, our target blockchain platform. 
This will speed up the implementation of the proposed demonstrator applications 
in the next stage.

Throughout the design process, the Hyperledger Composer notations are converted into UML sequence 
diagrams, class diagrams and activity diagrams with PlantUML, an open source language-to-diagram drawing tool.

The discussion below may regularly refer back to the functional requirements (FR) and 
non-functional requirements (NR) defined in the previous Chapter 4.

\section{Transaction Sequences}

A transaction is the only activity that a peer can perform to alter the state of the blockchain. 
Designing the sequences of transactions necessary to fulfil the desired use journeys will  
be able to provide a good overview of the work ahead, and the fields that data model 
objects should include to enable these transactions. Two overarching use cases are considered: 
assessment and curriculum personalisation.

\subsection{Assessment}

\section{Participant, Asset and Transaction Models}

\subsection{Participants}

The network definitions will involve two main types of participants: teachers (which can be lecturers, 
teaching assistants, tutors, etc.) and learners (which can be campus students, distant learners, etc.).
