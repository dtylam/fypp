Background literature review in Chapter 2.1 and 2.2 has driven the direction of the project and 
provided many of the functional requirements. This chapter describes the further collection of primary 
data, and provides the list of formal user requirements.

\section{Primary Data and Analysis}
Collecting primary data from shareholders of higher education e-learning systems would be able to:
\begin{itemize}
    \item reaffirm and further develop requirements obtained from literature
    \item obtain further requirements from real world painpoints and goals
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Methodology}

[TODO]

Method: qualitative

Instrument: Why interviews?

Sample: Participants are needed who are 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Teaching staff in higher education with 10+ years of experience
    \item Student
\end{itemize}Teachers with  in Who are they? Why? Convenience Sampling. Limitation: all CS department.

An ethics submission was completed on BREO and approval granted on 21st November. 
See Appendix (TODO) for the approved participant information sheet, consent form and example questions.

A total of five interviews were conducted between December 2017 and February 2018: 
two with teaching staff and three with student representatives. See table 
\ref{table:participants-req} for a more detailed description of these participants.

    \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{>{\bfseries}lX}
        Participant & Characterisation\\
        \toprule
        Educator A & lecturer in higher education for over 20 years, and an experienced higher education 
        administrator\\\midrule
        Educator B & lecturer in higher education for over 20 years, with research interests 
        in e-learning interactions, effectiveness and acceptance\\\midrule
        Student C & a university course representative for 3 years, which involves collecting and 
        communicating student feedback and attending staff-student liaison meetings \\\midrule
        Student D & a university peer assisted learning leader for 2 years, helping out lower level 
        students with their academic work by facilitating peer discussions, and escalating common problems
        to academic staff in debrief sessions\\\midrule
        Student E & a university course representative for 2 years and a peer assisted learning leader 
        for 1 year\\\bottomrule
    \end{tabularx}
\end{table}

\subsection{Interview Results and Analysis}

The raw data from interviews (transcripts) were contextually analysed and grouped into problem statements (PS), 
these problem statements were then sorted into groups to produce an affinity diagram (See figure 
\ref{fig:ps-affinity}).

Below you will find the sample questions asked for each group, detailed descriptions and relevant transcript 
snippets for each problem statements. 
Any specifics regarding course, staff and event details have been anonymised.

\section{Formal Requirements}

Table \ref{table:fx-reqs} lists out the functional requirements (FR) adopted by this 
project going forward. They are related to one or more of the problem statements (PS) gathered 
above from primary data, or to the literature reviewed in Chapter 2. 

Table \ref{table:nonfx-reqs} lists the non-functional requirements (NR) adopted by this 
project going forward. They are related to one or more of the problem statements (PS) gathered, 
or to usability heuristics.

These requirements have been ranked with the MoSCoW prioritisation
framework, which specified four levels of priority: Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, and Wonâ€™t Have 
this time \citep{agile2018moscow}. The MoSCoW levels are given from mainly a system engineering perspective 
in planning the minimum viable product for the demonstrator of this project, 
and do not necessarily reflect the priorities of the stakeholders.
