\chapter{Conclusion}

\section{Work Completed}

- proved that smart contracts can bring value to assessment and personalisation

\section{Limitations}

- limitations of development frameworks

- human limitations: the system has the potential to improve interactions but depends on quality of human inputs 

- explicit description of learning outcomes, programme specifications, grade descriptors is not enough, teachers should
engaging students in activities pre-assessment intervention \citep{bryan2006innovative}

- public awareness

\section{Future Work}

% - tests embedded in smart contracts instead of rest calls, which may not always be available

- consensus model for double marking, etc

-- reputation model and community policing build trust

-- who issues the award? different modes and uses. 

-- arbitration, appeals and extenuating circumstances
