\section{Future Work}

- tests embedded in smart contracts instead of rest calls, which may not always be available

- consensus model for double marking, etc

- the higher education community explicit description of learning outcomes, programme specifications, grade descriptors is not enough
engaging students in activities pre-assessment intervention \citep{bryan2006innovative}

-- reputation model and community policing build trust

-- who issues the award? different modes and uses. 

-- arbitration, appeals and extenuating circumstances
