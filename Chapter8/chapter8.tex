\chapter{Conclusion}

\section{Work Completed}

The main deliverables of this project have been the demonstrator system, and the 
design work on blockchain data models, Smart Contracts and access control rules, 
which were supported by literature and primary data.

Going back to the aim of the project (as in Chapter 1.1), an e-Learning platform 
that fulfils educational assessments has been successfully designed and built. 
Both teachers and students have responded positively to the improvements made 
in assessments and curriculum personalisation. The aim of the project has been satisfied.

This project has been a good proof of the potential benefits that blockchain systems 
and Smart Contracts can bring to education.

\section{Limitations}

The potential improvements in communication provided by the system are limited 
by human actors. Quality information and interactions are still dependant on  
teachers and students.
For example, \citet{bryan2006innovative} have noted that the explicit descriptions of 
learning outcomes, marking criteria and grade descriptors are not enough in higher education.
Teachers should engaging students in pre-assessment activities that create a 
social construct of what those statements mean.

The highly regulated and structured context of high education may have been limiting 
to this project. For example, institutions could be reluctant to liberalise their 
degree structures in order to protect their academic standards and reputation. 
A broader, general e-Learning platform for MOOCs or skill-sharing 
may have been a better fit for blockchain technologies.

Lastly, public awareness of the actual functionalities and benefits of blockchains 
and Smart Contracts seem to stop at the belief that they are more secure. Properties 
such as peer execution and consensus are not well understood. The user interfaces of 
the demonstrator applications could have done more to illustrate these concepts 
through animations and descriptions.

\section{Future Work}

There are many directions in which future work can go. Here are some of the ideas:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Create more higher education features}: 
    several features were unfinished and many more were suggested. For example: 
    certificates and transcripts; more assessment paradigms such as peer assessments, 
    self assessments, double marking; features that support arbitration, 
    appeals and extenuating circumstances for assessments.
    \item \textbf{Open-source development}:
    further develop the demonstrator system to create a versatile e-Learning software 
    platform that any interested developers can clone and fork for their own purposes. 
    This requires many improvements and may require changes to the current dependency on 
    Hyperledger Composer and Vue.js to overcome technical limitations.
    \item \textbf{Create a proprietary MOOC platform}:
    changing some of the designs to fit the Massive Open Online Course market 
    and productionising it, setting up a company to attract funding and content creators. 
    This again will require many improvements to the system built so far.
\end{itemize}

Public interest in blockchains has continued to rise, and the use of blockchain in education is continuing 
to gain traction. Most recently in March 2018, a group of academics at Oxford University has launched 
a for-profit online university using a blockchain back-end as a selling point \citep{pells2018blockchainuni}. 
While not popular yet, it is certain that the use of blockchains and Smart Contracts will 
have a foothold in the education sector in the near future.

% - tests embedded in smart contracts instead of rest calls, which may not always be available

% - consensus model for double marking, etc

% -- reputation model and community policing build trust

% -- who issues the award? different modes and uses.
