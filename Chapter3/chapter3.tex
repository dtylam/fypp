\section{Scope}

The aim of this project focuses on improving assessments and curriculum personalisation, and does not require 
coverage of all elements in the Learning Technology Systems Architecture (LTSA, Chapter 2.2.1). 
See Figure \ref{fig:ltsa-covered} for which parts of LTSA this project will attempt to cover, and 
Table \ref{table:ltsa-bcu} for the mappings from LTSA elements to the blockchain design objects in this project.

Components such as delivery and the storage of learning resources will be out of the scope of this project. 
A blockchain is also not the ideal storage service for multimedia data such as learning content and delivery activities 
due to the inherent high latency in consensus. Security and redundancy of these data is also unnecessary.
