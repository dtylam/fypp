\section{Scope}

The aim of this project focuses on improving assessments and curriculum personalisation, and does not require 
coverage of all elements in the Learning Technology Systems Architecture (LTSA, Chapter 2.2.1). 
See Figure \ref{fig:ltsa-covered} for which parts of LTSA this project will attempt to cover, and 
Table \ref{table:ltsa-bcu} for the mappings from LTSA elements to the blockchain design objects in this project.

Components such as delivery and the storage of learning resources will be out of the scope of this project. 
A blockchain is also not the ideal storage service for multimedia data such as learning content and delivery activities 
due to the inherent high latency in consensus. Security and redundancy of these data is also unnecessary.

\section{Project Timeline}

Figure \ref{fig:simple_gantt} shows the ten main stages of action, their timeframe and dependencies.
Fairly waterfall... research specific?

\section{Agile Software Development}

There are some agile software development principles that this project has chosen to adopt. 
Some clear limitations exist, for example, \citet{beck2001agile}'s agile manifesto asks for 
daily collaboration between customer and developers, and teamwork and interactions

Here are the tools that this project has used to manage the agile process. Here is 

Trello as Kanban

Github is a git-based version control, code hosting and project management service that offers free 
private repositories to verified students \citep{github2018education}.
