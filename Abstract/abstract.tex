    % • Overview of the Problem
    The properties of a blockchain could bring new features to e-Learning. 
    Properties such as immutability and peer executed smart contracts could bring a new level of trust, transparency and 
    personalisation to the education market.
    
    This project focused on features that would improve the experiences of students and teachers in assessments, and curriculum 
    personalisation. They were identified as two of the key concerns in the current UK higher education industry that can be 
    improved by a blockchain powered e-Learning platform.
    
    % • Approach
    % • Summary of the contribution and outcomes
    The logic of the smart contracts and data models for such a platform were proposed. A working prototype was also developed 
    based on the IBM Hyperledger Composer project.
