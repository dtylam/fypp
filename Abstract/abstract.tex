    The properties of a blockchain could bring new features to e-Learning. 
    Properties such as immutability, provenance, and peer-executed Smart Contracts 
    could bring a new level of security, trust, and transparency to the education market.
    
    This project focused on features that would increase transparency in assessments, and facilitate curriculum personalisation. 
    They were identified as two of the key concerns in the current UK higher education industry that could be 
    improved by a blockchain-powered e-Learning platform.
    
    % • Approach
