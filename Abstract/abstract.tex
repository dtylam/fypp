    The properties of a distributed ledger could bring new features to e-Learning. 
    Properties such as immutability and peer executed smart contracts could bring a new level of trust, transparency and personalisation to the education market.
    
    We focused on features that would improve the experiences of students and teachers in curriculum personalisation and assessment, which we have identified as key concerns in the current UK higher education industry.
